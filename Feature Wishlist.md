Listed roughly in order of priority but also ease of implementation


#### Big Ideas

- Athlete cards
- Customize Date Range of Athlete Results
- % Success Rate in Snatch, C&J, and All Attempts
- YOY % Progress in Total
- Meet Results Pages (with links to athlete pages for participating athletes)
- Athlete page result table with links to meet results pages
- Choropleth map for barbell clubs 
- IWF Results
- Athlete Page Overall Placement at National and International Events
- Athlete-to-Athlete Comparisons (potentially housed within the athlete page)
- Country Tagging/Grouping (IWF results is a prerequisite)

#### Small Ideas

- Result tables on athlete pages give the correct number of results above the table, but at the bottom it usually tells you a different number if there are more than 20 meets.
