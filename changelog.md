| ---------------- | ----------- |
| 9-1-2025         | Created search bar for meet results. <br> - Incorporated fuzzy search features <br> Improved fuzzy search for existing athlete search. <br> - Common name shortenings now reference full names, and vice versa (eg, Chris <--> Christopher) <br> - Certain known aliases were applied for specific athletes (eg, Mattie --> Martha)
| 8-31-2025        | Created meet results pages which contain (unofficial) division rankings and links to athlete pages. Athlete pages also contain links to historical meets within their competition results table. |
| 8-30-2025 &nbsp; | Fixed chart zoom function on athlete page. Now when zoom is turned on, hover cards (which were causing issues) are disabled. |
| 8-29-2025        | Disambiguation was not showing accurate WSO & barbell club information, making it difficult to... disambiguate |
| 8-28-2025        | Added name slug URL capability. <br> ../athlete/olivia-reeves already worked, but now typing in ../athlete/olivia reeves automatically converts the URL to ../athlete/olivia%20reeves which also works. <br> This is a nice feature but it isn't flawless. Some effort & precision is required from the end user. The name has to be spelled correctly, and there are also challenges associated with hyphenated names. <br> For example, ../athlete/Mary Theisen-Lappen will get converted to functional URL ../athlete/Mary%20Theisen-Lappen. However typing in ../athlete/Mary Theisen Lappen will not work since the URL conversion logic can't know where the space should go vs. where the hyphen between last name should go. <br> For athletes with duplicate names, typing their name(s) into the URL no longer shows an 'Athlete Not Found' page. It's now an athlete disambiguation page which shows you options to choose from the athletes with the same name. |
| 8-27-2025        | - De-duplicated most of the 1000+ athletes who share names <br> - Finalized start-to-finish daily scrape workflow which now includes de-duplication automation |
| 8-17-2025        | - Removed high-contrast theme and minimized the theme switching to a small button <br> - Made all card borders consistent <br> - Added toggle buttons to both charts on Athlete page <br> - Vertical hover line added to charts on Athlete page <br> - Removed Previous button when on the first page of result table & removed Next button when on the last page of result table results <br> - Added Chart legends <br> - Included brief description of both charts|
| 8-16-2025        | - Fixed nightly division scraper to now update WSO and barbell club info <br> - Fixed issue where result tables on athlete pages gave the correct number of results above the table, but at the bottom it told you a different number (in intervals of 20) if there were more than 20 meets. <br> - Added Level (local, national, international, etc.) to expanded meet results section within athlete page. <br> - Made light theme a little less harsh on the eyes. <br> - Made athlete results tables sortable |
| 8-15-2025        | - Created Light & High-Contrast themes <br> - Fixed search to include most recent WSO & barbell club information <br> - Added former Olympians (etc) to suggested search |
| 8-14-2025        | Added GitHub link to home page and reformatted footer. |
| 8-12-2025        | Q-scores for athletes <12 in age or <40 kg bodyweight were assigned NULL q-scores since these ages and weights tend to produce wild numbers. This will be done automatically by Supabase moving forward. <br> Also removed some obvious outliers from the database. If intent behind typo was obvious, I fixed it. If I wasn't sure, value was set to NULL. |
| 8-11-2025        | Table compact/expanded button with csv export to match WSO & Club columns added to expanded results table |
| 8-10-2025        | Expanded README.md |
| 8-9-2025         | Added vercel analytics functionality & github changelog & github feature wishlist |
| 8-8-2025         | Went live on vercel hosted site   |
