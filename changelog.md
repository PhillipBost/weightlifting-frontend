| 8-12-2025         | Q-scores for athletes <12 in age or <40 kg bodyweight were assigned NULL q-scores since these ages and weights tend to produce wild numbers. This will be done automatically by Supabase moving forward. <br> Also removed some obvious outliers from the database. If intent behind typo was obvious, I fixed it. If I wasn't sure, value was set to NULL.|
