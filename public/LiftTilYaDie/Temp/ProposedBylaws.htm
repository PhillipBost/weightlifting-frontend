USAW Bylaws. I will try to make my comments on the proposed Bylaws in
the order they appear, although at times I may expand that and/or
deviate a bit.<br>

<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have 2 items highlighted
here because I believe there are 2 problems:</font></font><br>
<font size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. At the 2002 Board of
Governors (BOG) Meeting, the membership voted down a proposal to limit
voting to those 18 &amp; Older. Also, would that be 18 in actual age or
in Weightlifting age? In Weightlifting, all Athletes are considered the
age they turn anytime during a calendar year. <br>
<br>
Apparently this last part was answered below in the USOC AAC Election
procedures where it says:<br>
<br>
</font></font><big><font face="Comic Sans MS">eighteen (18) years of
age or older by December 31 of the year in which the election is held.<br>
<br>
IF we leave the 18 age minimum, this language should also be added here.<br>
</font></big><font size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
2. 60 day membership seems to be an arbitrary number. Assuming that
future votes will be eMail and/or SnailMail in nature, it would seem to
mean that the "Date of an Election" is more a voting period, than a
date. Even if we stick with the 60 day rule, shouldn't then read "sixty
(60) days prior to the END date of an election" or some such language?<br>

<br>
</span><font size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This section is the
first appearance of the concept of the Nominating &amp; Governance
Committee (NGC), so I want to comment on it here. I was first exposed
to the USOC's idea of the NGC when I served on the USOC AAC and Board
of Directors (BOD) from Jan. 1989 until Jan. 1993. I immediately
realized that it wasn't a true Nominating Committee, but really a
"Coronating" Committee. By screening applicants and only nominating a
bare minimum, the USOC's Committee made sure they decided who would get
elected, which meant that those that controlled the NGC, would control
the USOC. This would be the same story in USAW.<br>
<br>
I believe that the NGC should be that of a "Verification" Committee. In
other words, if 5, 10 or 1000 people submit their names as candidates
for a position, the NGC should only verify that they did meet the
criteria for election to that position and make no judgments on those
applying to run. This is the only way to be fair to the membership and
all those wanting to serve.<br>

<br>
<big><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our current Bylaws also allow for a
Special Meeting to be called for by "one-fourth (1/4) of the Board of
Governors". I understand that these proposed Bylaws doesn't have a body
equal to the BOG, but there should be a way the Membership can "make"
the BOD have a meeting. Surely, the problems of this past BOD are
examples of areas where 1/4 of the membership may have agreed the BOD
needed to act (differently).<br>

would be better if the Membership directly elected the Chair. This
would help ensure that the BOD is lead by a person that a majority of
the Membership supported. With the proposed elections by segments, it
is possible that the BOD be made up of 10 Directors that only have
support from their particular segment. Choosing a Chair from that BOD
could mean the Chair could have less than 20% support of the
Membership. Surely not a good situation.</font></font><br>

convinced that having a staggered BOD is a good idea. It means that
every 2 years, new Directors have to be brought up to speed. I believe
the possibility of changing every 2 years is even worse of an idea for
the Chair. The Chair should sit for 4 years!<br>

power to select a member as well. This year's BOG voted down the idea
of the BOD having any say in this Bylaws Committee and as a BOG member,
I don't think they should have any say on the first NGC either. At a

7 members is being overly optimistic. I've been to most Athletes
meeting for the last 30 years and turn out is proportional to the
issues discussed. But even in years when there have been major
problems, it is hard to get more than 5 candidates for any position.
And it's even harder to get Athletes to serve on the various
committees. So it should be changed to a total of 5. 1 with the highest
votes, 1 each male and female with the next highest votes for their
gender and the USOC AAC Rep and their Alternate. Since the USOC AAC Rep
and Alternate have to be of opposite genders, this still gives the same
gender mix as the one proposed.<br>

attempt to wipe out the past. But for our Sport, LWCs work!. We had
Regions when we were part of the AAU, but after we broke away from the
AAU, they died mostly due to lack of interest. And State Organizations
are too Big for some States and too Small for others. Here in
California, we have 2 LWCs (down from the AAU's 4 Districts), but they
are run differently. So different that we can't even agree on what our
State Records should be! That is why we need to keep the LWCs and maybe
tweak them a little.<br>
