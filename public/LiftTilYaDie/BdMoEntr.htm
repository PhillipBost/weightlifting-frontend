Please enter me in the 1999 Bad Mother Open Championships to be held on July 24, 1999 at the Auburn Game Farm Park Amphitheater in Auburn, WA.  I certify I am an amateur in good standing.  In consideration of my entry in competition, I do hereby waive, and release the USAW,  Calpian Weightlifting club, Auburn Parks Dept., City of Auburn, and the Washington local weightlifting committee, it's directors, officers, officials, agents and competition personal, hereinafter known as the "organizers", from any and all causes of action, loss liability, claims and demands every kind and nature, which or my heirs or personal representatives may have for bodily injury, including paralysis, dismemberment and death, as well as loss of or damage to property and for expenses of medical treatment, hospitalization and other me rendered to me in the event of injury or illness, or for any and all other costs, damages or losses suffered or incurred by me or occasioned to me in connection with my travel to and from, and my participation in, the competition and related activities, except that the foregoing waiver and release shall not apply to injuries, damages and losses resulting from the gross negligence or intentional  misconduct of   the Organizers or to bodily injuries and medical expenses covered by accidental death, dismemberment and/or loss of sight and medical reimbursement insurance policies insurance maintained by the organizers.
<P>
I(and my parent or guardian, if I am a minor), agree that the Organizers and it's agents, including competition personnel, may make judgments (with appropriate input from available medical personnel), as to my treatment, hospitalization or other  medical care in the event of my illness or accidental injury in connection with my participation in the competition, should I become disabled or incompetent to make necessary and appropriate decisions concerning such treatment, hospitalization or other care.  I authorize the Organizers, its agents and competition personnel to make such decisions as they stood in relationship to me of parent, guardian or next of kin should circumstances require the organizers, its agents and competition personnel to make such judgments, and my next of kin cannot be timely and conveniently contacted to participate in the making of such judgments.
<P>
I hereby release and agree to hold the Organizers, its agents and competition personnel harmless from all expenses, causes of action, liability, claims and demands arising from good faith judgments made by the organizers,  its agents and competition personnel concerning my treatment, hospitalization and medical care in the event of my illness, injury or other emergent circumstances in connection with the competition.
<P>
I (and my parent or guardian, if I am a minor), agree that I will be financially responsible for treatment, hospitalization and other medical care rendered to me in the event if my illness, injury or other emergent circumstances in connection with the competition, except to the extent my injures and medical expenses, if any are covered by accidental death, dismemberment and/or  loss of sight and  medical reimbursement insurance policies maintained by the organizers for my benefit.  In this event, I will nevertheless continue to be financially responsible for expenses of treatment, hospitalization and other medical care in excess of such policy's limits.
