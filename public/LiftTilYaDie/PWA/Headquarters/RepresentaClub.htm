<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><B>eMailing Andrea Brinkman (andrea.brinkman@usaweightlifting.org) and requesting the change ~or~

<LI><B>If you are currently representing another Club, you will need to first switch to Unattached (by either method described above) for 4 months UNLESS:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><B>You get both your Old Club President AND your New Club President to sign the Change/Delete/Transfer form ~or~
<LI><B>You fill out the Change/Delete/Transfer form, have New your Club President sign it and have the Local Weightlifting Committee (LWC) President waive the Old Club President's approval by signing it. (This is only used when its been verified that the Old Club President has agreed, but hasn't signed the form).
</OL></OL>
If you are trying to make a change before a meet with less than 3 weeks to go, it may be too late to get it done by eMail. So if you eMail Andrea, bring a copy of the eMail to the meet so it can verified that it has been requested. Or if you want to do the form option, you should bring the form to the meet and it will be accept it there.
