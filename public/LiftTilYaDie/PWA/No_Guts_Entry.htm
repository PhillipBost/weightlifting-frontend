ENTRY AND FEE MUST BE IN BILL KUTZER’S POSSESSION OR POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN TUESDAY, AUGUST 2, 2005 TO AVOID LATE FEE!!! <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><U>NOTICE</U>:</FONT> The late fee has been raised to <u>$50.00</u> because so many people have registered in past meets the day of the competition which creates a great deal of extra work for the meet director and others involved in hosting the meet. Also, many entries get filled out incorrectly which becomes a big problem not only for the local director but also for the home office in Colorado Springs.
Early entries give us the opportunity to make corrections and adjustments. SO, GET YOUR ENTRIES IN ON TIME AND CORRECTLY COMPLETED!! 
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><U>ALSO NOTICE</U>:</FONT> You must compete in a ONE PIECE LIFTING SUIT as stipulated by the rules.
