<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please enter me in the 2003 Tyee Open Weightlifting Championships to be held on March 1, 2003 at the Tyee Senior High School in SeaTac, WA.   I certify that I am an amateur in good standing. In consideration of my entry in the competition, I do hereby waive, and release USA Weightlifting Washington Local Weightlifting Committee, the Tyee Weightlifting Club, and their respective directors, officers, officials, agents, clubs and competition personnel, hereinafter known as the "Organizers," from any and all causes of action, loss, liability, claims and demands of every kind and nature, which I or my heirs or personal representatives may have for bodily injury, for expenses of medical treatment, hospitalization, and other care rendered to me in the event of my injury or illness, or for any and all other costs, damages or loses suffered or incurred by me or occasioned to me in connection with my travel to and from, and my participation in, the competition and related activities, except that the forgoing waiver and release shall not apply to injuries, damages, and losses resulting from the gross negligence and/or wanton misconduct of the Organizers or to bodily injuries and medical expenses covered by accidental death, dismemberment and/or loss of sight and medical reimbursement insurance policies maintained by the Organizers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree to be filmed and photographed under conditions approved and authorized by the Organizers, to include the use of my name, biographical information, public appearances, interviews, photographs, portrait and motion pictures and television recordings of my weightlifting performance and grant to the Organizers the right to record and make use of the same, and to authorize others to do so in promoting the competition and the success of the weightlifting team on which I compete, to promote the image of USAW, the Washington Local Weightlifting Committee and its clubs, its sponsors and their advertisers, and the sport of amateur weightlifting, and to fund the activities of the USAW, the Washington Local Weightlifting Committee and its clubs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I (and my parent or guardian, if I am a minor), agree that the Organizers and its agents, including competition personnel, may make judgments (with appropriate input from available medical personnel), as to my treatment, hospitalization or other medical care in the event of my illness or accidental injury in connection with my participation in the competition, should I be disabled or incompetent to make necessary and appropriate decisions concerning such treatment, hospitalization or other care. I authorize the Organizers, its agents and competition personnel to make such decisions for me as though they stood in a relationship to me of parent, guardian or next of kin should circumstances require the Organizers, its agents and competition personnel to make such judgments, and my next of kin cannot be timely and conveniently contacted to participate in the making of such judgments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hereby release and agree to hold the Organizers, its agents and competition personnel harmless from all expenses, causes of action, liability, claims and demands arising from good faith judgments made by the Organizers, its agents and competition personnel concerning my treatment, hospitalization and medical care in the event of my illness, injury or other emergent circumstances in connection with the competition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I (and my parent or guardian, if I am a minor), agree that I will be financially responsible for treatment, hospitalization and other medical care rendered to me in the event of my illness, injury or other emergent circumstances in connection with the competition, except to the extent my injuries and medical expenses, if any, are covered by accidental death, dismemberment and/or loss of sight and medical reimbursement insurance policies maintained by the Organizers for my benefit, in which event I will nevertheless continue to be financially responsible for expenses of treatment, hospitalization and other medical care in excess of such policies' limits.</P>
